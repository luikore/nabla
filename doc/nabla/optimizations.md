- Baseline JIT just inlines jumps and procedure calls.
- Inline cache for most probably method entries, so JIT can determine whether inline it or not.
- For JIT, low level part of the bytecode is generated, to:
  - Eliminate consecutive value conversion calls
  - Eliminate reference calls
  - The low level bytecode is also used for static typed code targets
- Longer, aligned 128bit bytecode with annotation or smaller bytecode just 16-bit aligned?
- On-stack allocation of values, structs
- Eliminate structs that doesn't escape
- Eliminate dead code.
- Constant folding.
- Use mutable gpz structs when a variable can be replaced by results.
