- easy to use with free-form editor (adding or removing `)` is easy with operator precedence) or IDE (`:` can popup obj defined methods)
- relatively smaller core syntax
- data is immutable, with local variables and IO support
- more determinism in program reasoning
- reverse of parens (limited to infix operators, as little enhancement) for even less parens...
- extensible literal (sigils), no syntax composition problems since it is used with indented syntax
- pattern match
- parsing toolkit
- pi-calculus concurrency
